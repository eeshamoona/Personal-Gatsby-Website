_Remember when you used to play connect the dots as a kid? Well, let's talk about a different version of that game: finding the things that connect human beings together._


It's finally here! I've been wanting to start a podcast for a while now, and to finally have a link to the first episode is unreal. In this episode, I discuss the question: What are some topics that all human beings can connect on?  The goal of this question is to dive into the topic of human connection and all the different ways that we can relate to each other as human beings.
